# mt-sequential-multi-agent-rl

## Description
In this project, we propose the new rainforcement learning model called "Sequential-Multi-Agent".

## Requirements
This project require following environments.

|Environment|Version|
|:---------:|:-----:|
| Python | 3.6.x or later |
| Pytorch | 1.2.0 |

| numpy | 1.16.x |
| TensorBaordX | 1.9 |

And also this project require GPU environment.

## Benchmark game

This project use following Benchmark game.  
* Open AI Gym - Atari Pong **NoFrameSkip-v4**  
  [Rf) Open AI Gym - Pong-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pong-v0/)

## Usage

Use `src/app.py` for training and tesing the model.
Once executed, learning is executed with the default hyperparameter configrations.
